# Amiibo Nuxt Database

This is a hobby project created in Nuxt JS to test the features of Nuxt and getting hands-on experience with the framework. 
The project utilizes the [Amiibo API](https://www.amiiboapi.com/) to fetch data about various Amiibo figures. The Amiibo API provides the following features:

- Retrieve information about all available Amiibo figures.
- Get details about specific Amiibo, including name, series, and release dates.
- Access Amiibo images and artwork.
- Filter Amiibo data by game series, character, and type.

This integration allows the application to display up-to-date information about Amiibo figures dynamically.

Please Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more about Nuxt framework which is built on top of Vue JS.

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
